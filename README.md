# vlad-utils / amateur programming 

Well, I have this hobby so I thought to share some personal utils, projects and learning stuff. 
(vvvv patching & utils, some glsl really simple shaders.)

- GLSL -  really basic glsl shaders. 
- truchet tilling - simple spread system (4v), helps to create truchet tiles. (sort of tile designer included)
- 4v-utils - nothing special, some helpers for faster 4v patching.  

will keep uploading as I learn & do stuff :)
